## Personal Website Portfolio

This is a personal website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I’ve been wanting to build a personal website for a while, so I chose this as my project for the Web Development course at college.

With basic frontend experience and limited time in my daily schedule, I’m really happy with the result, especially considering I chose not to use any additional frameworks.
